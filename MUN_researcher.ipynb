under the 1937 French/Polish version of the planIn the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, there were a number of resettlement plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan.The head of the commission, Mieczysław Lepecki [pl], felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that, because of the climate and poor infrastructure, only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated.[a]In Nazi Germany [ edit ]Racism and antisemitism were basic tenets of the Nazi Party and the Nazi government.See also [ edit ]References [ edit ]Informational notesPlan abandoned [ edit ]With the failure to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the proposed invasion of the UK was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940.Göring\\'s office of the Four Year Plan would oversee the administration of the plan\\'s economics.In his May 1940 memorandum to Hitler, Concerning the Treatment of the Alien Population in the East, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler declared that he hoped to see \"the term \\'Jew\\' [...] completely eliminated through the massive immigration of all Jews to Africa or some other colony\".Planning continues [ edit ]Rademacher envisioned the founding of a European bank that would ultimately liquidate all European Jewish assets to pay for the plan.It was postponed after the Nazis lost the Battle of Britain in September 1940, and it was permanently shelved in 1942 with the commencement of the Final Solution, the policy of systematic genocide of Jews, towards which it had functioned as an important psychological step.According to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospectsthe total population was 28,915,653 in 2021, compared to only 4,084,000 in 1950.CitationsBibliographyFurther readingWith Adolf Hitler\\'s approval, Adolf Eichmann released a memorandum on 15 August 1940 calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years, with the island being governed as a police state under the SS.While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state.The proposal called for the handing over of control of Madagascar, then a French colony, to Germany as part of the eventual peace terms.British forces took the island from Vichy France in the Battle of Madagascar in November 1942 and control was transferred to the Free French.The plan has been characterised by the historian Ian Kershaw as genocide by an alternative method.The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat.Planning begins [ edit ]Initial discussions began to take place in 1938 among Nazi ideologues such as Julius Streicher, Hermann Göring, Alfred Rosenberg, and Joachim von Ribbentrop.The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office.The plan was developed by Referat D III of the Abteilung Deutschland.In late August 1940, Rademacher entreated Ribbentrop to hold a meeting at his ministry to begin drawing up a panel of experts to consolidate the plan.As of 10 July, deportations into Poland were cancelled, and construction of the Warsaw ghetto was halted, since it appeared to be unnecessary.On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Security Main Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years and abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe.By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany\\'s 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, and other countries, as well as the British Mandate of Palestine.Franz Rademacher, head of the Jewish Department of the German Foreign Office, proposed the idea in June 1940, shortly before the Fall of France.Most Nazi bureaus, including the Foreign Office, the Security Police, and the Generalgouvernement pinned their hopes on the plan as the last chance to \"solve the Jewish problem\" through emigration.With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of settling Polish Jews on the island.Rademacher recommended that the French colony of Madagascar should be made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe as one of the terms of the surrender of France, which the Germans had invaded on 10 May 1940.In particular, Hans Frank, governor of the General Government (the occupied portion of Poland), viewed the forced resettlement to Madagascar as being preferable to the heretofore piecemeal efforts at deportation into Poland.France surrendered on 22 June.Once planning for Operation Barbarossa commenced, Hitler asked Himmler to draft a new plan for the elimination of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich.By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop spoke of the Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France.Once it became apparent that the war against the Soviet Union would drag on much longer than expected, Heydrich revised his plans to concentrate on the Jewish population then under Nazi control.The plan was officially shelved within the Foreign Office in February 1942.The plan was not viable when proposed due to the British naval blockade.Józef Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany, expressed his country\\'s reluctance to take them back, and the Polish government decreed that Polish passport holders would not be permitted to return except under specific conditions.The plan hinged on the rapid defeat of the Soviet forces.They assumed that many Jews would succumb to its harsh conditions should the plan be implemented.He briefly considered Palestine as a destination, but deemed it unsuitable, as he considered it undesirable that a strong Jewish state should be created in the Middle East.Rademacher recommended on 3 June 1940 that Madagascar should be made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe.Franz Rademacher, recently appointed head of the Jewish Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarded on 3 June to his superior, the diplomat Martin Luther, a memorandum on the fate of the Jews.a b [3][4] the total population was 28,915,653 in 2021, compared to only 4,084,000 in 1950.The SS would undertake the expulsion of the Jews from Europe and govern the island as a police state.The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress.Planning for German deportations to Madagascar formally began in 1940.Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area.When Ribbentrop raised the matter with French foreign minister Georges Bonnet in December of that year, Bonnet expressed French reluctance to receive more German Jews and inquired if measures could be taken to prevent their arrival.As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview.Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland.Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in the East Africa Protectorate (modern-day Kenya), which was part of the British Empire at the time.Barren, unproductive lands were viewed as appropriate destinations as this would prevent the deportees from flourishing in their new location.Its Information Department, along with Joseph Goebbels and his Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, would control the flow of information at home and abroad.This meant the British merchant fleet would not be at Germany\\'s disposal for use in evacuations, and planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled.Establishment of ghettos in Warsaw and other cities in Poland resumed in August 1940.The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others.The Nazi leadership seized on the idea of deporting the remaining German Jews overseas.The Nazis expected many deportees to perish in the harsh conditions or die at the hands of the SS.This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar and the rest of the world, as Jews would not be allowed to interact financially with outsiders.France itself was contemplating how to deport some 10,000 Jews and considered whether Madagascar might be an appropriate destination.In addition, Palestine was under British control at the time.The RSHA, he emphasised, would control all aspects of the program.The Nazis expected that after the invasion of the United Kingdom in Operation Sea Lion that they would commandeer the British merchant fleet to transport the Jews to Madagascar.The resettled Jews, noted Rademacher, could be used as hostages to ensure \"future good behaviour of their racial comrades in America\".Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved.Additionally, Rademacher foresaw roles for other government agencies.Discrimination and violent attacks against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power in 1933.His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland.Luther broached the subject with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was simultaneously developing a similar scheme.Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country.Ribbentrop\\'s Foreign Affairs Ministry would negotiate terms with the French for the handover of Madagascar to Germany.Viktor Brack, a division chief in the Chancellery of the Führer, would oversee transportation.Likewise, Eichmann\\'s memorandum languished with Heydrich, who never approved it.Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften (\"German Writings\").It would also play a part in crafting other treaties to deal with Europe\\'s Jews.Ten per cent of Jews under German jurisdiction by that date were Polish nationals.Rademacher said: \"The desirable solution is: all Jews out of Europe\".Ribbentrop never responded.'}, {'topics':

activities that could build their resilience.”Initial assessments have shown that this support has been especially beneficial for women, who are gradually becoming self-reliant and investing in small family businesses to boost their incomes.I was no longer satisfied with growing rice as my father did, so I decided to start a nursery and sell my clove, coffee, banana, and ravintsara seedlings.”Renowned cash crops in this southeastern region of Madagascar, coffee and clove seedlings are best sellers.Diana Styvanley, World BankShort-term income support during difficult timesProductive cash-for-work activities essentially involve building assets or upgrading infrastructure that will benefit the entire community.He established it shortly after participating in a series of training sessions organized by the productive cash-for-work program (ACTP) on how to produce, cultivate, and increase the number of seedlings.Training and awareness-raising sessions are also provided in such as areas as composting, community savings, family budget management, nutritional education, parental education, hygiene education, and water and sanitation.“The ACTP is a safety net program designed to supplement the income of the poorest households by providing them with short-term income support during difficult times in exchange for carrying out certain activities.This program appears to be working well, as the mid-term review reveals that the beneficiary households have used the income earned from 80 days of annual work and training to improve their living conditions and gain more economic opportunities.She decided to invest in a pond after attending three training sessions on fish farming, and already has 150 fingerlings in her pond that was constructed specifically in accordance with required technical standards.Pierette decided to invest in a pond after attending three training sessions on fish farming, and already has 150 fingerlings in her pond that was constructed specifically in accordance with required technical standards.As a result, communities in five districts in Madagascar have reforested 764 hectares of land, developed 900 hectares of fields, irrigated 12,700 hectares of farmland, and planted over three million seedlings in nurseries since the start of the program in 2015.Taking his business to a higher level or learning a trade through trainingBenja’s household is one of 31,250 vulnerable households benefiting from this program, which was rolled out in five districts in Madagascar.In one year, Benja sold over 700 clove seedlings and as many coffee seedlings in the city of Manakara.In the village of Andremanta in the district of Manakara, each member contributes a minimum of 500 ariary to the community savings pool, which serves as a fund that can be used by members in an emergency or to finance their own projects.Diana Styvanley, World BankBy planning, developing, and producing together, and by participating in training tailored to production needs in communities, the ACTP also strengthens social cohesion.In the village of Andremanta in the district of Manakara, each member contributes a minimum of 500 ariary to the community savings pool, which can be doubled or increased up to five times every week.This is what is known as the productive cash-for-work program,” explains Julia Rachel Ravelosoa, Senior Social Protection Economist at the World Bank.The World Bank has provided more than $14 million in financing for this program since 2015 through the International Development Association

nursery, and I am thinking of expanding it,” notes Benja Voajanahary.These lean seasons typically occur before the harvest and during preparations for the start of the school year.Projects are spread over 80 days each year and are executed during periods of low agricultural activity or lean seasons, when households are in dire need of support.It introduced and developed the concept of community savings in villages by creating village savings and loans associations (VSLA).It has helped women like Penalie Christine, a 35-year-old single mother of three young children, who sells small donuts on the roadside to make ends meet.After joining the VSLA, she secured a loan for 50,000 ariary ($16) from this association in February 2019 to grow her business and has now added bread and hot coffee to her items for sale.She is considering getting another loan so that she can sell biscuits and sweets as well.She hopes to be able to reap the benefits of her investment by June 2019.This savings pool serves as a fund that can be used by members in an emergency or to finance their own projects.But now I am happy to be a member of the VSLA, which helps me invest, make plans for the future, and earn a little more,” she explains.So I already had some knowledge that was really enhanced by the theoretical and practical training I received under the program.The financial support that we receive from the VSLA as members is extremely important for all of us women.”“My father was a farmer and I always helped him when I was a boy.“I am a single mother and I have never relied on anyone to raise my

by climate change impacts.', 'important facts': 'Further deterioration is expected, especially in Southern Madagascar, between December 2022 and March 2023 , when more than two million people will likely experience high levels of acute food insecurity under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system used by international organizations to determine food security risks, with 284,600 people facing an emergency.According to preliminary IPC Nutrition survey results, nearly half a million (479,000) cases of global acute malnutrition (severe and moderate) are expected in Madagascar between September 2022 and March 2023, a 55% increase over the period ending August 2022.Anticipated recovery in economic activity will translate to a gradual decline in poverty rates, from a historical high of 81.9% in 2020 to 81.2% in 2023 and 80.7% in 2024, thereby remaining above pre-crisis levels.Legislative elections held in May 2019 gave the president’s party a majority in the National Assembly, while communal elections in November 2019, and senatorial elections in December 2020, further consolidated the ruling party’s hold, resulting in majorities in both houses of Parliament.In the absence of bold reforms, Madagascar might take a decade to reverse the loss in average incomes that occurred during the 2020-22 COVID crisis and more than 70 years to reach current living standards in Rwanda, which is Madagascar’s closest aspirational peer.According to the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), as of mid-September 2022, 8.8 million people across Madagascar (about 33% of the population) are food insecure, one million more than three months ago.As a result, the COVID-19 crisis reversed more than a decade of gains in income per capita and pushed the poverty rate to a new record high of 81% (measured against the international poverty line of $2.15/capita/day).The crisis was compounded in the South of Madagascar by historic droughts that led to widespread crop failure, growing food insecurity, and internal migration.Development ChallengesGrowth remains structurally constrained by inadequate human capital and infrastructure, a high prevalence of informality, and self-subsistence agriculture, as well as governance and institutional weaknesses.Economic SituationDevelopment prospects in Madagascar continue to be hampered by the country’s low growth potential and its exposure to frequent, deep, and persistent crises.In July 2022, the government raised the fuel price at the pump by an average 34%.This represents a nearly 23% increase compared to the situation in the last quarter of 2022, and a nearly 81% increase compared to April-August 2021.Fiscal policy was able to play a stabilizing role during the crisis, as the government ramped up public spending, but as a result, public debt increased significantly, reaching a projected 53.8% of GDP in 2021.However, it was followed by a recession about three times deeper than in most of the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, with the sharp contraction of minus 7.1% in the economy due to the economic impact of pandemic closures on Madagascar’s mining, tourism, transport, and service sectors, and to the impact of drought and livestock disease on agriculture in the South.Growth projections for 2022 were downgraded to 2.6% (from 5.4%), meaning GDP per capita will stagnate and remain about 8.5 percentage points below pre-crisis levels.Growth had started to recover in 2021 but was interrupted again in 2022 by a third wave of the pandemic followed by a sequence of severe weather events and the adverse effects of the war in Ukraine.Safety net spending is very low: 0.3% of GDP, compared to the average of 1.2% of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa.Despite considerable natural resources, however, its population of about 28 million (2020) has one of the world’s highest poverty rates.Political ContextPresident Andry Rajoelina and Prime Minister Christian Ntsay have led the country since January 2019.Madagascar’s next presidential elections are scheduled for 2023.The country has the world’s fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition; 97% of Malagasy children aged 10 are unable to read and understand a short, age-appropriate text.The government has 30 ministers, including 9 women.Debt distress risks are currently assessed to be moderate, assuming ambitious efforts to boost revenue mobilization and prudent management of public debt and contingent liabilities take place.Growth averaged about 3.5% a year in the years between the country’s return to constitutional order in 2013 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.Growth is expected to pick up to 4.2% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024, with structural constraints and slowing external demand preventing a faster rebound.Madagascar is also one of the African countries most severely affected by climate change impacts.A government reshuffle was carried out in mid-March 2022.This latter is expected to have important repercussions, as it will negatively impact economic prospects in the European Union, Madagascar’s main trading partner.It has already led to significant upward pressure on global energy and

and recover from frequent shocks such as climate-related disasters.Affecting almost half of all children under 5 – the world’s tenth highest rate – chronic malnutrition is considered as one of major public health concern in Madagascar.Climate change and environmental degradation exacerbate these risks while the increasing fragility of the ecosystem intensifies vulnerability to shocks and food insecurity.Deforestation has become a major concern: 90 percent of Madagascar’s original rainforests have been lost to logging, charcoal-making and slash-and-burn agriculture.In 2022, several tropical cyclones hit Madagascar, claiming scores of lives, destroying houses and essential infrastructure, displacing people and inundating croplands just weeks away from harvest.Rice is the main staple food and the island’s main crop, but not enough is produced to satisfy the national demand.This has had a disastrous impact on agriculture and forced people to resort to desperate survival measures, such as eating locusts, raw red cactus fruits or wild leaves.However, the country has faced challenges in its socio-economic development and in recent decades it has experienced a stagnation in per capita income and a rise in absolute poverty.Agriculture is dominated by rain-fed small-scale subsistence farming: seven out of 10 smallholder farmers own no more than 1.2 hectares of land.The costs associated with child undernutrition represent 14.5 percent of the country’s GDP.With a gross domestic product per capita of US$422, the country is ranked 164 out of 189 according to the 2020 Human Development Index.The world’s fourth largest island, Madagascar boasts a unique ecosystem, with many species of plants and animals found nowhere else.WFP’s work is concentrated in the disaster-affected southern, south-western and south-eastern regions.Madagascar is among the ten countries most vulnerable to disasters and is considered to be the most cyclone-exposed country in Africa.A quarter of the population lives in areas highly prone to cyclones, floods or drought.Political instability undermines government institutional capacity, economic growth and development efforts.The Grand Sud region has been struck by back-to-back droughts during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 rainy seasons.Farming, fishing and forestry form the backbone of the Malagasy economy.\"},

have a critical role to play.“They have land, they have access to some seeds and they are located in the region affected by the drought, where there are other people who cannot access water, are under or malnourished.”Hers is a sad story and an all too common one across the island nation off the southern coast of Africa, which is struggling with extreme weather – 1.1 million people are suffering from hunger, with nearly 14,000 people in “famine-like conditions” – a figure expected to double by the end of the year.“They are planted in April, watered three or four times and they produce a harvest.”WFP aims to empower farmers like Odile to grow more crops, better and fulfil dreams such as sending their children to university.Most people who received the insurance payouts this year spent it on food – Odile is among the one percent who used it to rent land.Her youngest two children go to school and she is hoping for progress to continue so that she can afford to send her eldest children to university – and possibly become state employees in the agricultural sector, she says.“The system relies more on social pressure than bureaucratic rules and structure,” says Frederica Andriamanantena, Climate and Insurance Officer for WFP in Madagascar.Frederica says that because of the group “rules and solidarity and the way members helped each other, they somehow survived the drought”.A community leader who liaises closely with both WFP and UNICEF on matters of nutrition, Odile cares for three children, other than her own – of relatives who were unable to feed them.WFP

putting the futures of children including Odile’s in question.The ones that don't look so good she separates to cook for her family – twice a day they eat.Next year, WFP will pay only part of the premium and after that she should be in a position to pay for the whole amount herself.The strength of savings groups lies in how members advise each other, and build relationships based on trust.Had WFP not intervened, Odile would likely have continued planting on her old land, hoping for the best — it’s a similar story across the country.This provides a critical lifeline for Odile amid the drought that is crippling the region.Photo: WFP/Alice RahmounNow, before selling her beans, Odile sorts them and keeps the waste beans.Photo: WFP/Alice RahmounNext season, WFP will pay only part of

doesn’t.Eventually, she should be in a position to pay for the whole amount herself.She adds: “We really wanted to build insurance schemes so that it doesn't disturb any social organization, but provides an additional service to the already existing organizationSavings-and-loans cooperatives are the bedrock of WFP’s microinsurance schemes – they must have been running for at least a year to qualify for WFP support.Photo: WFP/Alice RahmounThe last rains were in April.Everything would be organized within the group and the representative would be in touch with the insurance company and its

“they stock up and leave,” she says.With less than US$200 from a WFP-backed microinsurance programme, Odile has gained access to a field where she can grow potatoes and other crops.“They don't spend money”.Odile separates the less good-looking beans for her family meals, and sells the rest.But they are located in remote areas… the savings groups came as the potential solution to that.Beans are

age and incredible variety of lifestyles and adaptations, the lemur branch of the primate family tree is particularly interesting to scientists.The sheer size of Madagascar (nearly 1000 miles long and 350 miles wide) coupled with the diversity of Madagascar’s regional climates and habitats – desert, lowland and high altitude rain forest, dry deciduous forest, mountains and valleys, grasslands, spiny forest and knife-edged limestone formations – creates such a vast array of habitats for wildlife and plants that Madagascar is often referred to as the “Eighth Continent.”Studying these traits in lemurs provide key clues about primate evolution and also now hint at exciting scientific discoveries that will impact humans.Isolated for nearly 150 million years, the plants and animals of Madagascar spent millions of years evolving their own unique characteristics, not to be found elsewhere on the planet.Such extreme endemism is characteristic of all forms of life on this oceanic island with 98% of the mammals, reptiles, and amphibians and over 90% of the (more than 12,000) plant species being found nowhere else on the planet.By non-invasively studying lemurs, DLC researchers gain tremendous insight into primate evolution and human health and behavior.Isolated on the tropical island for millions of years, with ample resources and few predators or competition, they evolved and diversified to fill the island’s many ecological niches.In addition to their beauty, rareness, and importance to their native ecosystems, lemurs resemble our earliest primate ancestors.Remarkably, the more than 100 species of lemurs found in Madagascar exist naturally nowhere else on earth.For example, some lemur species develop the same plaques and tangles seen in the brains of humans diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and features some of Earth’s most amazing and diverse biological life.Pictured: Madagascar is home

only 41%, 17%, and 23% respectively, with higher inaccessibility in rural areas.[1]With funding from USAID and charity: water, CRS is working in twelve regions with innovative approaches in communities, clinics and schools using sustainable solutions.Ravaged by global warming, Madagascar’s landscape sees increasing cyclones, unpredictable rains and chronic drought, particularly in the South of Madagascar where more than a million people linger on the brink of starvation, largely because it is not raining consistently enough to grow food.CRS will serve them in several ways: restore land through agroforestry production; engaging government, businesses, and communities to improve environmental stewardship; increase opportunities for youth; and improve education and health of farmers.Adult literacy and Saving and Internal Lending Communities are two other important activities which are changing people’s lives by helping people access information and money.CRS will support tree nurseries, train farmers on climate-smart agricultural practices and financial management and support farmers to save and access credit.CRS is working to ensure that households are able to withstand shocks and climate-related stresses with a strong focus on inclusion—to make sure that youth, girls and people with disabilities are reached.With that in mind, SPICES will work with schools and agricultural training programs to improve the overall management of resources for schools, teachers, and school and training center infrastructure — all priorities for famers and families in the region.Maharo builds on multi-sectoral food and nutrition security projects implemented by CRS in the south of Madagascar since 2008, in collaboration with the Government of Madagascar’s technical and administrative services, local and international developmental organizations and Catholic Church partners.Maharo (“capable to protect or defend” in Antandroy) is a $45 million comprehensive food and nutrition security program designed to prevent and reduce acute food insecurity among the most vulnerable people, households and communities in the deep South of Madagascar over five years (2019-2024).Current projects are funded primarily through USAID: $45 million for a five-year development project and 20 million for two one-year emergency projects.Photo by Sedera Ramanitra/CRSUSAID, CRS, and multiple private sector companies from the cocoa value chain understand the devastating problems facing the Malagasy people and their environment and have formed the TSIRO alliance.Sustainability is key and this market-incentivized model, combined with support for financial management, youth empowerment and optimal agriculture practices are fundamental to alleviating poverty over the long term.However, CRS invests not only in infrastructure but on governance and putting in place systems and structures to make sure there is a plan for maintaining the water systems, toilet blocks and handwashing stations.The economic impact is also significant, as prices have increased dramatically, exports have dropped, tourism is almost non-existent, and lockdowns forced people

effective diagnosis and management of Tuberculosis.We work with communities to understand their priorities, strengthen local governance structures, and encourage positive health and agriculture practices.Maharo is strengthening systems and risk mitigation strategies to enhance and protect the resiliency of communities, households and individuals most vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity.In fiscal year 2020, CRS helped 112,000 people access safe drinking water.CRS is supporting families to improve their health; their livelihoods through agriculture, fisheries and livestock; improve social services and safety nets.CRS is repairing water points to provide much needed water to people in this extremely arid environment.We promote safe prevention practices that support health workers and health facilities with vital sanitation, trainings, and equipment.CRS will do this by supporting farmers and cooperatives to plant endemic trees to expand forests, fruit trees to improve healthy diets, and cash crops to increase revenues.CRS gives food to over 220,000 people and provides nutrition counseling and monitoring to over 25,000 children.In 2020, CRS provided cash transfers to vulnerable people when lockdowns affected their ability to work and earn wages.A major focus of the project is increasing revenue of farmers from cash crops such as vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, turmeric, ginger and cocoa, while simultaneously protecting forests.The additional income from cash crops will allow farmers to invest in education, nutrition and health care.Currently, around 1.14 million people in the deep south are hungry, with 14,000 experiencing famine conditions.CRS is working with the government and several partners to diagnose people with TB early and successfully treating those who have TB.Also, CRS is working with the Ministry of Health to create mobile clinics to expand access to the vaccinations.We promote vaccinations by leading webinars and presentations that provide people the chance to ask questions and receive the most up-to-date information.We are committed to continuously reinforce our programs and systems and develop staff competencies while promoting local leadership within our staff and with our partners.While official numbers show 937 deaths as of July 2021, the damage is likely much higher and will only continue until many more people are vaccinated.The planned diversification of these systems will bring farmers out of poverty and support the biodiversity Madagascar rightly prides itself on.CRS also serves health care facilities to reduce infections and create clean, desirable and well attended facilities.CRS Madagascar will continue to develop partnerships with church structures, civil society organizations, private sector entities and the government of Madagascar.The deep south of Madagascar is suffering from a major drought because of poor rainfall, complicated by COVID-19, sandstorms, and pest infestations.CRS

ripe for strategic investment in the agriculture sector.Over the past five years, the southern region of Madagascar has been affected by recurring droughts.It's critical that CRS continues food distributions.CRS is also thinking about long-term solutions to drought and poverty.GDP per capita is $528, and the country ranks 164 out of 189 in the 2019 Human Development Index.We know that sustainable change at scale must include all stakeholders.As in most of the world, COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the country.The incidence of tuberculosis is falling globally as in Madagascar but not fast enough, where there are 233 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.Madagascar also has one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in the world.We currently have 680 staff and continuing to grow.It remains one of the most fertile countries in the world.Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world.The woman on the right is the secretary of the group.Nearly the entire population

($1 - 1.50), at local Malagasy restaurant or about 10,000 at a nicer \"touristy\" restaurant (~$5).Public transportation, such as brousses, are inexpensive -- fares can be between 2,000 ($1) and 60,000 Ariary ($20) typically, depending on the distance of your ride.However, some regions (especially in the north of the island) continue to quote prices on the old currency (Franc), which is about 5x more than the Ariary (e.g. 5,000 Ariary = 25,000 Franc).Many people fly for a lack of time, in order to see as much as possible.Domestic flights can be costly ($500, for example) through Air Madagascar, but people under the age of 27 and residents of Madagascar receive a discount.On your journeys, you may have to cross water on a bamboo raft, or chug along at a slow pace behind

generations, to set up their own projects and share actionable advice.So, Stella set up a project with tourism operators in the region to find out this important information.She’ll interview inspirational figures from her network of marine scientists and experts to find out about their epic ocean stories, expertise and fieldwork.Since then, the project has identified over 400 individual whalesharks, published several peer-reviewed studies, implemented a code of conduct and initiated a local education programme.I felt there was a stark lack of information about the realities of working in the conservation sector and running a successful organisation.She continued: “I don’t think it's helpful – for individuals or the sector as a whole – if we’re only sharing what went well.I

'“Innovation can help accelerate economic recovery and put countries on a path to sustainable and greener growth,” Viju Ragupathi, a professor at Brooklyn College, New York, said in a research paper, titled ‘Innovation at country-level: Association between economic development and patents’.“And this puts us in a poor position when compared to other developing countries in Africa.”Further analysis of the index shows Mauritius, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Ghana, Namibia, Senegal, the United Republic of Tanzania, Rwanda and Madagascar are the 10 most innovative economies in the region.“In the lower middle-income group, 14 economies including the SSA economies such as Côte d’Ivoire (109th), Nigeria (114th), Zambia (118th), Cameroon (121st), Benin (124th), Angola (127th) and Mauritania (129th) performed below expectation for their level of development,” the report said.Out of the seven indicators used for the GII ranking, the country ranked 69th in business sophistication, followed by creative outputs (97th), human capital and research (109th), infrastructure (112th), institutions (112th), knowledge and technology outputs (123rd) and market sophistication (126th).And in terms of research, the institutions that are supposed to carry out innovative research that can move the country forward have been on strike for over seven months,” Akinwunmi said.A report by International Finance Corporation also highlights the existence of a skills gap, outdated curriculum in engineering programmes and lack of opportunities for students to apply skills learned in the classroom in most African countries including Nigeria.It is an important policy tool that allows countries to assess their innovation performance and undertake a cross-country comparative analysis.Read also: Nigeria’s failure to encourage investors hampering economic growth- NESG“The completion rate between entry into primary one and completing university is eight percent.“The indicators used in the ranking says it all,” says Ayodele Akinwunmi, senior relationship manager at FSDH Merchant Bank.It is no wonder that the United Nations Children’s Fund said the country has the highest number of out-of-school children in the world.Experts say innovation, a process of creating new technologies, opportunities or ideas, is also one of the contributors to economic growth.Ragupathi added that it allows a country to discover opportunities that exist or are likely to emerge in time, to focus on existing business processes and practices that improve efficiency, to find potential customers, to minimise wastage, and to increase profits.So, this is the reality,” Muhammad Sanusi, former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, said at the Kaduna Investment Summit last year.Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, is not among the 10 most innovative economies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), securing the 13th position in the region in the latest 2022 Global Innovation Index (GII).According to the annual index done by the World Intellectual Property Organization, Nigeria also performed below expectations as it ranked 114th globally.Akintunde Adeyemi, an information security officer at a Nigerian bank, told BusinessDay that the scale of research and development programmes that drive worldwide innovative activities is very small in Nigerian universities.The GII captures the innovation ecosystem performance of 132 economies and tracks the most recent global innovation trends.Over the past few years, budgetary allocation to education in Nigeria has not been more than seven percent of the federal government’s budget.“Nigeria is lacking in proper infrastructure.Out of every 100 children who go into primary one, only eight end up coming out of the university.The government is not working on it as they spend less on it every year.And out of these, nine percent will get a job.'}, {'topics': ['human', 'rights', 'china', 'development', 'progress', 'countries', 'people', 'right',

human rights for human civilization progress, global human rights theory and practice, and developing countries does not mean that there's no omission or inadequacy in China's human rights.\", 'important facts': 'The international human rights treaties, such as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), International Bill of Human Rights (1966), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) have provided substantial rule and theoretical support for promoting the rule of law in human rights and for advancing the right to life, the right to freedom, the right to dignity, the right to justice, the right to property, and the right to development.It can be said with confidence that China\\'s human rights progress has expanded the world\\'s established path to human rights development from the 20th century, making China the firmest major country in supporting the UN Human Rights Council and offering new options for developing countries to re-embark on the journey to improve their human rights.On June 22, 2017, the UN Human Rights Council adopted the resolution Contribution of Development to the Enjoyment of All Human Rights proposed by China, bringing for the first time the concept that \"development contributes to the process of promoting and protecting human rights\"into the international human rights system, which has won widespread support from various countries, especially developing ones.It can be said confidently that China\\'s human rights progress has shone highlight on the global efforts to advance human civilization in the 21st century, as China has substantially advanced human rights progress while fending off the disasters threatening human rights.Certainly, the elaboration of the global significance of China\\'s human rights for human civilization progress, global human rights theory and practice, and developing countries does not mean that there\\'s no omission or inadequacy in China\\'s human rights.It can be said with confidence that China\\'s human rights progress has provided methodological breakthroughs for realizing the world\\'s human rights theories and has given hope for fully achieving the great human rights ideals of humanity in the middle of the 20th century.Based on the execution and experience of the first three phrases of human rights action plans, the constitution\\'s principles, the \"14th Five-Year Plan,\" and the conformity of international human rights treaties, China has confirmed the phased goals and tasks to respect, protect, and promote human rights from 2021 to 2025.Instead of blindly following the human rights path of the West, China has prioritized the people\\'s right to subsistence and right to development, emphasized and performed the principle of not interfering with national sovereignty, and taken an independent path to human rights development that suits China\\'s national conditions.Third, China\\'s human rights progress is a new reference for facilitating the human rights development of developing countries as rank outsiders.China\\'s human rights progress has made it possible to have a practical breakthrough in the human rights goals that have not been achieved even by developed countries in the West.Since China\\'s first-time national planning with human rights development as the theme on April 13, 2009, China has released four phases of work goals and specific measures to promote and safeguard human rights.The three perspectives above show that the West has neglected the global significance of the remarkable development of China\\'s human rights, unceasingly criticized the specific detail and China\\'s human rights cases, and even magnify them to discredit China\\'s national image.Even in the USA with the strongest overall national strength, there has been prolonged racial discrimination, weapon proliferation, and unfulfilled medical insurance for all, making the country known as the \"cancer of human rights\" and causing the dilemma of \"easy to grasp the theory of human rights but difficult to put into practice.\"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN General Assembly established that safeguarding human rights is an important normative value in constitutions, international law, and international social judgment.It is believed that China will further develop its human rights undertaking and make greater contributions to the development of human rights around the world.Second, China\\'s human rights progress is a breakthrough in the realization of the world\\'s human rights theories.Had China made no progress in human rights, the history of human civilization would have been bleak in the first 20 years of the 21st century.It has not only failed to provide a fundamental prescription for the complex human rights development paths in the world but also led the national development and transformation of many developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to diverge from the correct paths.First, China\\'s human rights progress shines highlight on the global efforts to advance human civilization in the 21st century.For a long time, Western society has stressed the human rights development path of taking political selection rights as the core concept, emphasizing free competition as the social logic, and favoring the priority of capital as the policy evidence.Compared with the people in other countries, the Chinese people have felt the minimum impact on their daily life from the disasters (wars, economic crises, climate changes, famines, and others) that take a toll on human civilization\\'s progress in the 21st century.In the past, due to China\\'s relatively slow development of human rights, China responded with silence or limited rebuttal to the West\\'s accusations, and generally speaking, showed a lack of confidence.In fact, as the largest developing country, China is and will still be in the primary stage of socialism over a long period of time, with great development potential for national income, environmental protection, social equity, legal development, cultural services, political rights, and other aspects.Confidence has been growing among the Chinese people who have the courage to have head-on debates with the West but also elaborated on the significant contribution that China has made to the development of human rights in the world.In my opinion, most of the Western media and politicians have failed to notice at least three perspectives of China\\'s human rights progress, which are of global significance.China\\'s human rights progress can be said to rise against the world\\'s downward spiral.[JIN DING/CHINA DAILY]Thanks to the misinformation and disinformation spread by some Western media and politicians, many focus on the accusations of China\\'s human rights record.Meanwhile, the USA, regarded as the \"beacon\" of human civilization, and Europe, viewed as a \"model\" of international governance, have encountered a multitude of crises such as social disorder, rising populism, polarization between the rich and the poor, security threats, among others, which have caused waves of pessimistic sentiment unprecedented in the West.In September 2021, the Information Office of the State Council released the Human Rights Action Plan of China (2021-2025).At the same time, many human rights problems in Western society have been fully exposed in the age of information.Since the start of the 21st century, the evolution of human civilization has been subject to huge shocks, inflicted by military conflicts, economic woes, climate change, crop failure and famine, pandemics, etc.Hopes of seeing greater development in human civilization than that of the second half of the 20th century have come to naught.Having created the world\\'s best and most stable social environment in terms of urban security, China has effectively prevented its people from being threatened by guns and safeguarded their right to life, right to property, and right to dignity.The prevalence of digital economy (including takeaway services, express delivery, online shopping, car-hailing services, and others) has led to the equalization of basic social services in urban areas, which has greatly narrowed the disparity of social progress dividends caused by the disparity between the rich and the poor.Since the start of the 21st century, China has witnessed rapid economic growth, particularly making rapid development in infrastructure construction, prevalence of the digital economy, and triumph over poverty.In 2021, about 700 million people were still living in extreme poverty around the world, most of them concentrating in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.Besides, it was announced that the poverty-stricken people in rural areas under current poverty standards have all been lifted out of poverty, thus solving the problem of absolute poverty, which is of historical significance.China has promoted the whole-process people\\'s democracy and improved the infrastructure coverage in terms of internet and transportation, thus effectively safeguarding Chinese people\\'s right to freedom in politics and livelihood.Since the start of the 21st century, more than 10 wars, including the Afghanistan War, the Iraq War, the Syria War, the Libya War, the Yemeni Civil War, the Civil Wars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Conflict with Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Darfur Conflict, the on-going Russia-Ukraine War that is fought fiercely, and others have resulted in over 20 million refugees and over one million deaths.China\\'s approach has won the support and affirmation of over 100 countries and has even been referred to, learned from, and copied by an increasing number of developing countries.The international financial crisis in 2008 shrank the wealth of over 100 million people across the world.In the past decade or so, the retrogression from 0% to 1% in the extreme poverty rate has also occurred in traditionally developed countries such as the US, Japan, Italy and Sweden.In 2021, the number of Chinese people that have signed up for basic medical insurance reached 1.36 billion, accounting for over 95% of the whole population.China has made all-out efforts to prevent and control the pandemic, double its forest coverage, and promote low-carbon development...In the past 40 years, China\\'s population of ethnic minorities has multiplied several times, effectively fulfilling international conventions on opposing racial discrimination.These moves have gone against basic facts, reflected the West\\'s narrowness in theory and perspective, and reflect the West\\'s arrogance and even wickedness in diplomacy.There has been an extreme poverty rate of over 70% for years in countries such as South Sudan, Burundi, Somalia and Madagascar.Every year, over 130 million people have been plagued by prolonged famines.Natural disasters caused by climate change result in five million deaths annually.In the past 40 years, there have been no wars launched by China, no famine, or financial crises.Also this year, the number of China\\'s netizens exceeded one billion.There is, however, a gap between theory and reality.'}, {'topics': ['new', 'like', 'shows', 'cbs', 'cast', 'roles', 'tv', 'credit', 'image', 'east'], 'url':

reporting and photography, Mr Butler, 44, has steadily built up his environmental news site Mongabay, which today has a global reach, with more than 800 correspondents covering issues in more than 70 countries.He said Mongabay, a non-profit outfit, has expanded far beyond what he had ever imagined when he started the site back in 1999.\"This is a great honour that I feel extends well beyond me to the entire Mongabay team and everyone involved with Mongabay\\'s work,\" he told The Straits Times after his win in September.\"Most importantly, Mongabay\\'s journalism has had real impact on the world, which is something we all can be proud of,\" he said.In recognition of his work, Mr Butler recently won the US$250,000 (S$357,000) Heinz Award for the Environment.His goal is also to educate people so that they can make better decisions.Mr Butler says Mongabay plans to keep expanding.There are six recipients annually.The journey has not been without risks.It currently publishes in English, Bahasa Indonesia, Spanish, French, Hindi and Brazilian Portuguese.We added an indigenous news reporting team last year,\" he said.\"Some areas in which we\\'ve been stepping up investment

strategies in order to ensure their survival.”‘Little Chance’ to SurviveCo-author Luca Santini, who studies large-scale ecological patterns at Sapienza University in Rome, said the combined results of the study tell an interesting story about how some primate species may be “capable of adapting to the rapid changes we are experiencing globally by modifying their behavior,” he said.Once you get rid of those trees, then there’s going to be other species that are going to go with those as well.”Co-author Giuseppe Donati, a lecturer in primatology and biological anthropology at Oxford Brookes University, said the research supports an evolutionary biology theory that more flexible species can adapt quicker and more successfully to changes.“If something disrupts that natural reproductive pattern, you may have 10 years between births, and that is a really dire situation.”A Kid With a NotebookEppley and 117 co-authors from around the world analyzed 151,000 observation-hours on 47 arboreal primate species to identify behavioral traits linked with spending more time on the ground.Since some primates only reproduce once every few years, habitat disruptions can be “devastating.”“We don’t have a huge opportunity when they’re faced with these issues,” he said.Isalo National Park, which is one of the major tourist sites in Madagascar, is currently on fire, and this is something similar to what you see in Brazil, especially this time of the year.”Long-term conservation plans like reforestation and the creation of migration corridors are important, “but I would also say that we need to put in efforts to simply protect the habitats that we have,” he said.The new study helps show similar patterns in similar species, “as these habitats are degraded, and the climate worsens, with hotter temperatures, we’re finding that these arboreal primates are more likely to shift to life on the ground,” he said.The species that are able to find relief on the ground are those that may have a better chance to adapt,” they concluded in the paper, “but less adaptable species may require prioritized conservation strategies.”“What we found here is that populations that have a more generalized diet, and so are more ecologically flexible, and live in larger groups, with a more developed sociality, are those more likely to descend from the trees and spend time on the ground,” he said.“Here we focus on behavior, which is something rarely studied at such scale, [or] for making inferences on climate change adaptability.”Primates are critically important for forest ecosystems, Eppley added.That makes the research unique because most other studies tend to focus on “species distribution or population level responses,” he said.“You know, the pace at which climate change and anthropogenic factors are degrading habitats, it’s just happening so fast,” he said.The species was “on all accounts, an arboreal species feeding mainly on bamboo,” he said.Otherwise, “they’re just going to end up in these fragments [of habitat] and slowly die off because they have a restricted gene pool and aren’t able to disperse,” he said.“From that moment I was just kind of hooked with primates,” he said.Many of them pollinate trees and disperse seeds, particularly in Madagascar, he said, where some trees are completely dependent on seeds spread and germinated by primates, he said.But it’s also troubling to realize that “even the most flexible and adaptable of the animals, the primates, have little chance to survive the pace of human-induced modifications.”“There was a study earlier this week about how more than half of the world’s bird species have populations that are declining,” he said.It was a fragmented and degraded ecosystem and I found that that species was spending a ton of time on the ground, for all of its activities, both feeding and for resting.”“We expect this, but when we use field data and large-scale analyses we rarely find crystalline trends,” he said.The group of 47 primates scrutinized in the new study was selected from the tree-dwelling species for which they could find good behavioral data, which provided a baseline that allowed them to measure the ecological pressures and anthropogenic pressures on the animals.“I did a deep literature dive, and I emailed everybody that had done a behavioral study that was 10 months or longer,” he said.“For these species, these traits are kind of like a pre-adaptation that allow them to persist on the ground.”While shifting climates shaped primate evolution over geologic time scales, including leading some that lived in trees to move to the ground, Eppley said he doesn’t expect any of the 47 species his international team studied in the Americas and Madagascar to transition to a fully terrestrial lifestyle.“The more flexible of our cousins are already doing their best to cope with the changes we caused, while those who are more specialized are more likely to have troubles,” he said.In new research published Oct. 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists showed that global warming and habitat degradation appear to be driving many arboreal primates down from the trees and on to the ground, where their survival is uncertain.The species that are less adaptable, including those that subsist on tree fruits, or those living in very small groups, are very vulnerable, and efforts to protect habitat for them is not keeping pace with global warming impacts, he added.“In Madagascar, for example, there are multiple national parks that are on fire right now,” he said.And it has this cascade effect on the whole ecosystem,” he said. ”I always had this kind of extreme interest in behavioral observations of the wildlife around me.”He pursued that interest in college, taking his first paid research job with the Max Planck Institute in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Donate NowConservation scientists will have to develop and quickly implement effective strategies to protect them, said Timothy Eppley, lead author of the study and a wildlife researcher at the San Diego Zoo.They found that primates with less fruit in their diets, as well as those that live in large groups, in hot climates and where tree cover is decreasing, descended from trees more often, perhaps seeking to cool off, find water or seek alternate food sources.He said field work during his Ph.D. research on southern bamboo lemurs offered some early clues about how climate and habitat change pressures primates to descend from trees.Each one of those observation hours is one of us following that primate in its natural habitat.”“So while the study is not focused on global change specifically, it gives some good insights on species flexibility, which is something we rarely know.In climate change studies we often make simplistic assumptions that species will continue to behave the same in altered environments.”“As numerous species potentially go extinct, then those trees will eventually go extinct as well.Eppley said the data-gathering and analysis was a big effort, but it may have been a perfect challenge for him.All of our family trips revolved around visiting national parks,” he said.There just isn’t enough time, he said.Some species will just run out of room as equatorial waters and many mountaintops grow too warm for them.And moving down to ground would also expose the primate to new predators, requiring additional adaptation, the authors noted.The fossil record is filled with evidence of things like beech trees in Antarctica.But few species, if any, have survived a climate shift as sudden as the one humans have triggered with greenhouse gas emissions and global disruptions of forest, field and aquatic ecosystems.Climate and fossil records show that big swings in the Earth’s average temperature over eons radically changed the distribution and composition of life on the planet, wiping out entire groups of plants and animals in some areas, including large land mammals, while enabling others to thrive in unexpected places.“I grew up in Michigan, and I spent a lot of time outdoors.Eppley put the findings squarely in the context of the current human-driven mass extinction.“But in the habitat where I was studying them, there was no bamboo.“I would keep a notebook, as a third- and fourth-grader, and I would follow groundhogs, taking notes about what they were up to, and what the neighborhood was up to.“I think 40 percent of Baie de Baly National Park National Park in Northwest Madagascar has burned.“And tropical birds are also responsible for seed dispersal.And if we lose them, God help us.”“And thankfully, there were a lot of people.Fish are swarming poleward in both hemispheres, and trees are climbing higher up mountainsides to escape the rising heat.We have a really remarkable set of data that covers over 150,000 observation hours.Keep

challenges on nearly every climate metric: be it sea level rise, the melting of Himalayan glaciers, an increase in the number of destructive cyclones or extreme heatwaves.Defunct information commissions : Two information commissions—Jharkhand and Tripura—out of 29 across the country have been completely defunct for 29 months and 15 months respectively.:India should acknowledge that the

world’s population, over a quarter of world exports, and make up around 30% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP).It is through this dialogue that the world can achieve global visions of sustainable development encompassing observance of human rights, mutual respect and the alleviation of poverty, all of which are at the heart of UNESCO’s mission and activities.The Indian information law, rated as one of the strongest in the world, needs to be bolstered by raising awareness amongst the people and organising rigorous training of government officials .It is imperative to ensure freedom of the press and democratic institutions, punish errant officials and maintain complete autonomy of the information commissions, in the interest of the people and the nation at large.Marketing

dispassionately review its position on RCEP and carry out structural reforms that will help India to mitigate some of the repercussions arising from the RCEP.India’s trade deficit with RCEP countries

October, Save the Children has released a new photo series showing how families around the world are being priced out of their favourite plates of food.The unprecedented global hunger crisis has been fuelled by a deadly mix of poverty, social injustice, gender inequality, conflict, climate change, and economic shocks, with the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine further driving up food prices and the cost of living.The cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on families and children across Syria with a predicted 5.5 million people requiring food support between 2022 and 2023.“Our conversations with children confirm what we have been seeing through our programmes - children are living the reality of a profound, unprecedented hunger crisis on a daily basis, and without urgent action, the frequency and impact of hunger, conflict and other crises are set to increase in the years ahead.”Gabriella Waaijman, Save the Children’s Global Humanitarian Director, said:“This year Save the Children heard from over 50,000 children who spoke about how climate change and inequality is impacting their lives.One of the critical issues they raised was how rising food prices were being felt by their families, including through eating less – as well as poorer quality — food.One child is already being pushed into severe malnutrition every

where deforestation has caused profound changes to the landscape.\\nLike many regions in Madagascar, Andramasina has seen its agricultural calendar disrupted by drought.', 'important facts': 'Bôndy, a young Malagasy company, has social-impact tree planting at the heart of its “business model.”Bôndy makes money by offering social and environmental responsibility solutions to other companies, by planting trees on farmers’ land on their behalf.“The team’s ‘one tree planted = one tree grown’ slogan convinced us that their sustainable model of integrating stakeholders and closely monitoring progress would guarantee the creation of promised carbon sinks,” says Fanilo Rakotovao Rakotoarison, social impact director for the Axian Group.Some conservationists, however, are skeptical about the environmental impacts of Bôndy’s approach, which focuses mainly on planting non-native acacia and eucalyptus trees that can be cut for fuel and timber, as well as fruit trees.“These trees will not necessarily contribute to the conservation of native biodiversity and could not really be called ‘restoration,’ because they do not restore what existed before,” says Christian Kull, a professor at the University of Lausanne’s Institute of Geography and Sustainability and an expert in Madagascar’s ecosystem landscapes.“They are the ones who feed all of Madagascar and also those who suffer the most from climate change.”Bôndy’s approach is to plant useful trees in deforested rural areas like Andramasina, to enable farmers to earn a living and reduce pressure on remaining forests.The overall survival rate for the trees grown at both nurseries is 60%; trees that don’t survive are replaced during subsequent tree-planting campaigns, according to a Bôndy spokesperson.Although it has only been operating since 2018, the company’s model is proving successful with both the rural people receiving tree-planting services and the companies financing the projects.He also says that unlike forest restoration, it’s fine for reforestation projects to plant trees in areas with no original forest cover.The word Bôndy means a “million” in Malagasy slang; the company adopted this name as a symbol of its ambitious tree-planting goals.In addition to fruit trees, the company mainly plants exotic species that aren’t necessarily compatible with its objective of improving biodiversity or combating drought, experts say.Because our land is deteriorating so much that it’s being washed away by runoff.”According to Rivosoa Marcello Andriamampionona, Bôndy’s technical and operations assistant in Andramasina, the company has partnered with some 40 farmers to plant around 82,000 seedlings since 2020.The company can also cater to farmers’ specific requests: Andramasina farmers have asked for haronga (Harungana madagascariensis), a native tree used in traditional medicine.“As long as you factor in the surrounding ecosystems when choosing which species to plant, you can mitigate the risks,” he says.In any case, the impact would be minimal because Bôndy focuses mainly on practical tree-planting projects with trees intended to be used for wood or fruit trees.What about ecosystems?Bôndy’s business goals could come at the expense of its avowed commitment to biodiversity and ecosystem restoration.Reforestation, as practiced by Bôndy, is different from forest restoration, as it simply involves planting trees raised in nurseries on deforested land, whether the trees are native, exotic, or cultivated in agroforestry systems.Bôndy also plans to limit the sedimentation of the lake by planting native trees around it in the future, according to Fontaine.He just told me that his bigger trees were more valuable than the shrubs I was offering him,” he says.These include fast-growing exotic species, which farmers can use to make charcoal — the primary source of energy in Madagascar, where in 2020 only a third of citizens had access to electricity, according to the World Bank.“So it doesn’t make sense to talk about carbon sequestration,” Rasolonjatovo says.Bôndy makes money by offering social and environmental responsibility solutions to other companies, by reforesting farmers’ land on their behalf.According to him, Bôndy’s carbon sequestration methods are still being analyzed by researchers at the University of Antananarivo’s College of Agricultural Sciences, and he says he doesn’t want to offer these services before the methods get the green light.With these technologies, all tree data from nursery to planting — including plant name, age and size, soil quality, plot boundaries and GPS coordinates, and the farmers who planted them — are stored by the company.As a social enterprise, it aims to create both positive environmental impacts as well as economic value for farmers participating in its projects.The lack of trees as a result of logging and land clearing for agricultural plots has silted up the lake and lowered its water level.Although Bôndy varies the species it plants to avoid monocultures, it doesn’t plant many native species, at least not yet.Although it’s only been operating for a short time, the company’s model is proving successful with both the rural people receiving tree-planting services and the companies financing the projects.Bôndy and other tree-planting projects value Acacia dealbata and its fellow legume-family tree Leucaena leucocephala for their utility and rapid growth, but in other countries they’re considered invasive species.They plant fruit trees next to their agricultural plots, using agroforestry techniques they learned from Bôndy.Projects mainly focused on social impactThe level of the Sisaony, Andramasina’s main river, was so low that people could easily walk in the canyon that constitutes the riverbed.They tend to the young plants for seven hours a day, working toward a target of producing 10,000 tree seedlings per year.“But deforestation has left the area very dry.”Now 40, Randrianarisoa spent his childhood in Andramasina in the 1980s and witnessed the landscape deteriorating in front of him.Esther Razanamanana, a 69-year-old farmer, says she feels she benefits from the program in Andramasina as she no longer has to pay someone to buy her seedlings at the market or to plant them.Exotic species risk becoming invasive, reducing organic carbon in the soil and harming pollinators, among other potential risks listed in the study.To meet the social and environmental responsibility commitments and the terms of their clients’ contracts, Bôndy monitors tree-planting operations for the duration of the five-year contract, Fontaine says.“People think that when we plant trees, we’ll end up with a mini forest with trees very close to each other.The trees stand about 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall on average, and are about 2 years old.The Axian Group, made up of nearly three dozen companies in Madagascar, including the telecoms company Telma, BNI bank and the industrial group Viseo, is partnering with Bôndy on other tree-planting projects, including one that’s restoring mangroves in Majunga, in northwestern Madagascar.It takes 10-15% of the financing for its operations, and also aims for returns on investment by later taking a share (about 49%) of the farmers’ crops.Bôndy’s business modelWhen launching projects, Bôndy selects rural areas where deforestation has caused profound changes to the landscape.In Madagascar, several groups and companies are starting to grow trees, and are placing tree planting at the heart of their business models.It’s crucial not to plant acacias and eucalyptus at high altitudes or near water sources, as the roots of these trees can grow very deep into the ground to draw water, according to Nicolas Naina Rasolonjatovo, head of the reforestation department at Centre ValBio, a research institute near Ranomafana National Park in southeastern Madagascar.Forest restoration, on the other hand, focuses on broader objectives by taking ecosystems into account and aiming to restore what originally existed.“That’s agroforestry, the trees have to be spaced 2 meters apart,” Fontaine says.These native grasslands would be better carbon sinks than new forests.Tree planting has become widespread in the Madagascar highlands, especially since the Malagasy government launched a campaign in 2020 that mixes exotic and native species.“There used to be a lot of water and natural springs in this area,” says Gilbert Randrianarisoa, head nurseryman for the Malagasy company Bôndy.L. leucocephala is on the IUCN list of the world’s 100 most invasive foreign species.The survival of seedlings in the face of bad weather, destruction by livestock, or even vandalism, is a challenge, according to Andriamampionona.“We don’t make any carbon sequestration guarantees, as companies are not paying us for that,” he says.Their 2020 study found that not only is their replacement with exotic tree species damaging, but on a large scale it would reduce the flow of rivers, with unknown environmental consequences in the context of a changing climate.In the summer month of December, a part of the river traversing a small hill of primary forest would normally be rapids.A destination hiking site for residents of the capital, its water level is abnormally low for December.In the village of Antolojanahary, 100 km (60 mi) north of Andramasina, Bôndy has set up a nursery and a tree-planting project that brings together around 70 participating households.However, some conservationists question the environmental impacts of Bôndy’s approach.In this context of utilitarian reforestation, the trees Bôndy plants, such as Leucaena leucocephala (which has edible shoots), Acacia dealbata and various species of eucalyptus, can be used for fuel or construction.Around 10,000 seedlings have been planted since 2020.Rasolonjatovo maintains that this practice should be avoided, as foreign species risk destroying native trees, which are fragile and take a long time to grow.Bôndy also plants bamboo species, such as Dendrocalamus strictus, to improve soil fertility and protect against erosion, and fruit trees as cash crops.“Farmers make up the majority but are the least included in society,” Fontaine says.People in Andralanitra selected for their motivation are moved to Antolojanahary to make a living from agriculture.We want to change this vision of tree planting.”doi:10.1111/gcb.15498Solofondranohatra, C. L., Vorontsova, M. S., Hempson, G. P., Hackel, J., Cable, S., Vololoniaina, J., & Lehmann, C. E. (2020).In the long term, restored native forests maximize biomass and capture much more carbon while preserving biodiversity, according to a study published in 2021 in the journal Global Change Biology.Tree planting is being adopted everywhere as an easy solution to restore balance that everyone can contribute to in the face of the global climate emergency.“It suits us because in addition to the harvests, it gave us work,” says Fideranasoa Rakotoarimanana, one of the nurserymen.Tamboho Hotels, now owned by the Radisson group, also works with Bôndy in Andramasina.This article was first published on Mongabay’s French website here on Aug. 3, 2022.Citations :Di Sacco, A., Hardwick, K. A., Blakesley, D., Brancalion, P. H., Breman, E., Cecilio Rebola, L., … Antonelli, A. (2021).Bôndy established its fruit and tree nursery project in Andramasina in part to tackle these issues, Fontaine says.“You know, we will always need it later,” Razanamanana says.In this village, the company’s nursery employs three young nurserymen, the only ones employed among the farmers participating in the project.doi:10.1098/rspb.2020.0598FEEDBACK:After low rates of tree survival, one of the biggest challenges Bôndy faces is local people’s expectations and attitudes, according to Randrianarisoa, the head nurseryman.He’s now trying to restore it, little by little, with the trees he grows: more than 186,000 green shoots that line the nursery’s long benches.Image by Nirina Rakotonanahary for Mongabay.Bôndy is one of them.Scientists are particularly concerned about the use of exotic monocultures for tree planting.It aims to provide farmers with more income so that they no longer feel the need to exploit the primary forest, as a way to protect biodiversity.These types of trees have a reputation for depleting water sources — a particular problem in Andramasina and Antolojanahary.The company uses technologies such as GPS and blockchain to monitor its projects, and to guarantee transparency and impact.Despite the thousands of trees that Bôndy has planted in Andramasina and Antolojanahary, the plants that are growing are sparse.Like many Malagasy people and even Andramasina locals, Fontaine says he firmly believes that the highlands of Madagascar were once almost entirely covered in lush primary forests.The company says it hopes this popularity will help it reach its business targets.Bôndy counts several large international companies among its clients, such as Lacoste, which, with its Malagasy supplier, Epsilon, supports projects in Antolojanahary, 60 km (37 mi) north of Antananarivo.According to Fontaine, there are many reforestation projects in Madagascar, but they lack impact and transparency, which is one reason that motivated him to create Bôndy.There is also a risk of displacing native biodiversity, especially through the modification of non-forest ecosystems.“One day I told someone to replace his pines with young plants that are less harmful to the soil.Ten golden rules for reforestation to optimize carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery and livelihood benefits.These are being cut at a rapid pace across the biodiversity-rich island country as a source of charcoal and building materials and to clear arable land for agriculture.Bôndy focuses on the social impact of its projects.Despite the company’s youth and the questions about its environmental effectiveness, a lot of hope rests on Bôndy.However, Fontaine is cautious about guaranteeing carbon sequestration in Bôndy’s projects.The company was even appointed by the environment ministry to represent Malagasy youth at the COP26 U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021.“To fertilize the land and green the landscape.Farmers also use the sacred lake of Ambohimanjaka, although it’s artificial, to irrigate the surrounding fields.Malagasy researchers have demonstrated that the central highlands of Madagascar, which are largely in Analamanga, probably weren’t originally covered with forest, but partly with grasslands.Bôndy consults local farmers first to obtain their approval, assess their needs, and go through the terms of the contractual partnership.To protect yields, people have had to divert some streams and waterways from their usual path, to irrigate rice fields or other areas.Bôndy isn’t the only company to have adopted this approach.Nexta, a startup incubator owned by the Axian Group, one of the largest conglomerates in Madagascar, finances Bôndy’s projects in Andramasina.There’s also the issue of carbon sequestration, which seems to be part of what attracts Bôndy’s corporate clients.The town is just 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Madagascar’s bustling capital, Antananarivo, but it takes two and a half hours of driving to get there on poor roads.The first Akamasoa village was founded in 1989 in Andralanitra, near a gigantic urban dump in Antananarivo, where the poorest survived on foraging in the city’s rubbish.It’s possible that the Andramasina and Antolojanahary regions were never originally covered with forests, despite popular belief.The regions can also be chosen by local personalities, such as the late Michel Domenichini Ramiaramanana, a well-known champion of the Malagasy economy and culture who hailed from Andramasina.Like many regions in Madagascar, Andramasina has seen its agricultural calendar disrupted by drought.Opeka built a village to offer them a refuge, train them and give them work.ANDRAMASINA, Madagascar — It’s transplanting season in Andramasina’s rice fields.They can also generate economic benefits for local communities.Fire and grazing determined grasslands of central Madagascar represent ancient assemblages.Antolojanahary village is an extension of this

based on their full certificate program.', 'important facts': \"Both FDCE and TFL participants have been serving “clients” for YSE practicum courses, and Gillian Bloomfield ’10 MFS, program manager at ELTI, notes that students are thrilled to have their coursework “rooted in real-world examples that help affect positive environmental change on the ground.”“In terms of immediate impact, participant satisfaction, and global reach, it’s hard to top these two programs,” says Dean Burke.“At FDCE, our theory of change is that through online education, we can almost immediately equip those working in the energy sector across the globe to accelerate a clean and just energy transition.”Yale School of Management Lecturer Richard Kauffman, chairman of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, interviews Bert Hunter, chief investment officer of the CT Green Bank, on innovative financing techniques for clean energy development on January 27, 2020.“As we continue to grow the program, a key focus will be on admitting diverse cohorts of energy professionals which, hopefully, helps to build a diverse clean energy workforce,” says Coral Bielecki ’18 MESc, CBEY’s online programs director.“In my position, I used knowledge and skills — particularly strategy development, networking, and fundraising — to lead the design of a 10-year strategic plan for the ministry, develop and implement a new national environmental program, and help establish new environmental policy,” Razakamanarivo says.The goal of the TFL program as a whole is to challenge participants to think critically about what it takes to make their project plans actionable, says ELTI Director Eva Garen ’95 MESc, ’05 PhD.“When they finish the program, participants have an implementable project that they can then put into action or find funding to support.“I want to get us faster at piloting new technologies and processes and scaling the successful ones for maximum impact,” says De Grandis, who credits the FDCE certificate program with helping her make “the jump from government policy to utility strategy at a key inflection point for utilities.”“The online certificate programs were developed because there are working professionals worldwide who are eager to have access to the type of advanced environmental education and training that we can offer, and many of them are not able to, or don’t want to, enroll in a graduate degree program,” says Indy Burke, Carl W. Knobloch, Jr. Dean of the Yale School of the Environment.“The general FDCE approach is to find the right balance between engaging videos, readings, and interactive online discussions to keep our online cohort of working professionals excited, interested, and not overwhelmed — because they all have full-time jobs,” says Rob Klee '99 MEM, '04 JD, '05 PhD, who leads the energy policy portion of the course.Miles Braxton Director of risk management, Summit Ridge Energy & co-founder, BlackOak CollectiveBraxton says his FDCE network, particularly the connection that he made with fellow participant Sara Kane ’07 MEM/MBA, then a managing director at the insurance brokerage firm Beecher Carlson, played an important role in his transition to risk management.Halfway across the world, the desire to be part of an innovative space in the clean energy sector led Giselle De Grandis, a former senior policy advisor for the Ontario Ministry of Energy and Transportation, to enroll in Financing and Deploying Clean Energy (FDCE), the online certificate program offered by the Center for Business and the Environment at Yale (CBEY).“But ultimately, the biggest benefit of this program will be for Madagascar, where building our capacity to handle environmental challenges is a national priority and must be strengthened,” Razakamanarivo says.Having the ability to call Sara (now a co-leader of the power & renewables department at CAC Specialty) with a question any time, no matter how simple, as an unbiased professional resource and a trusted friend was one of the biggest reasons for my success in risk management.”Soon after completing the FDCE certificate program, Braxton co-founded BlackOak Collective with the purpose of establishing a Washington, D.C.-area network of Black professionals, students, and advocates within the sustainability space.With core course modules in policy, finance, technology, and innovation, FDCE’s courses are designed to help working professionals gain fluency in areas outside of their own area of expertise — engineers, for example, who understand clean energy finance, or policy analysts who can evaluate technology.“Their record of success is why we are so excited that funding provided through the Three Cairns Climate Program for the Global South not only expands access to these remarkable programs, but also will support the development of new certificate programs relevant to the Global South.”“The online certificate program provided a step-by-step approach and processes that helped me to understand the problem from the perspective of a ‘socio-ecological system,’” Hoque says.“We have already been able to reach more than 2,500 people through this course,” says Karin Bucht ’15 MF, program manager at ELTI who helped launch the MOOC-style course.He wanted to get some formal training in clean energy project finance to help him transition to a role at an asset management or investment firm that owned or acquired renewable energy projects.“The program also helped me develop indicators to measure progress and communicate how stakeholder needs were being met.”“I had been looking for years for a program like this… It gave me new insight into my duties as a professor and allowed me to be part of the decision-making process for the future of the ministry.His goal, he says, was to gain a better understanding of “regeneration potential, restoration approaches, and stakeholder engagement.”Creating Enduring ChangeParticipants in the TFL program, who come from a wide range of government agencies, academic institutions, and NGOs, take core courses in topics such as land-use strategies, human dimensions, and financial concepts, and complete a capstone project.While the significant federal investment in clean energy and renewables incorporated in the Inflation Reduction Act has been widely applauded by clean energy advocates, over at FDCE they are accustomed to thinking in terms of an ongoing global energy transition that requires, above all, human capacity and leadership.Herintsitohaina Razakamanarivo Professor, University of AntananarivoSometimes, it’s not just project plans, but the participants, who find themselves being made “actionable.”Learning how to do a sensitivity analysis (also known as a what-if analysis) within a financial model was mind-blowing at the time, and a tool I still use today,” he says.In February, TFL launched a Coursera course, “Tropical Forest Restoration 101,” based on their full certificate program.That experience led him to his current role as director of risk management at Summit Ridge Energy, one of the largest owner-operators of community solar assets in the U.S.I enrolled in FDCE primarily for the project finance module.Of these, approximately $1 trillion per year must be dedicated to the deployment and financing of clean energy,” says CBEY Executive Director Stuart DeCew ’11 MEM/MBA.Miles Braxton was a business development analyst at Washington, D.C.-based solar finance and development firm Sol Systems when he enrolled in the FDCE program in 2020.The progress they make over the year is impressive and generates enduring changes in the landscapes where they are focused,” Garen says.Razakamanarivo says she continues to use skills she gained in the TFL program in her academic career.But ultimately, the biggest benefit of this program will be for Madagascar, where building our capacity to handle environmental challenges is a national priority and must be strengthened.”She told me she worked in renewable energy insurance, and I laughed at the response, claiming I had no idea insurance existed in the industry,” Braxton says.People of color make up about 27% of the clean energy workforce in the U.S., according to a report by the nonpartisan group E2 and other energy organizations — slightly higher than the overall U.S. labor force (22%) and fossil fuels overall (26%).“The International Energy Agency estimated that $3.5 trillion per year in energy investments would be required until 2050 to offset the rise in carbon emissions.FDCE has been working to bring the demographic composition of the program’s participants in line with the energy workforce, with 47% of the current cohort identifying as people of color.“It has been exciting to find new ways to reach a broader audience and raise awareness on course themes.”Like De Grandis and Hoque, participants are often looking to strengthen existing skills, develop new knowledge outside of their own areas of expertise, or access professional networks that otherwise might be unavailable to them.TFL has had 191 professionals from 55 countries complete its program, with 74 new participants from 29 countries making up its 2023 cohort.The organization recently launched its Green Gateways program to build the pipeline of Black students into sustainability positions through presentations at colleges, universities, and HBCUs.“I am particularly excited about the Thursday hour-long live sessions during which I get to interview a guest expert from the energy policy world.Over 400 working professionals from 27 countries have participated in the FDCE program, with 117 participants from 21 countries making up the 2023 cohort.In 2019, he enrolled in the Tropical Forest Landscapes: Conservation, Restoration & Sustainable Use (TFL) online certificate program offered through the Environmental Leadership & Training Initiative (ELTI) at the Yale School of the Environment.Both certificate programs are going into their fourth year, and both are highly rated by past participants.That is certainly the case in the Cox’s Bazaar region, where Md. Ehsanul Hoque has utilized skills acquired in the TFL certificate program to help restore the landscape and lessen the environmental impact of forced migration.New Haven NexusesFinding the new opportunities to grow and build networks across Yale and externally have been a priority for both programs.It’s an opportunity to bring the clean energy news of the day into the FDCE ecosystem.”This year, the programs were able to offer scholarships to qualified applicants from the Global South thanks to the newly launched Three Cairns Climate Program for the Global South at YSE.Segments from the interview were incorporated into the FDCE program curriculum.TFL enrolled 16 participants as Three Cairns Fellows in this first year, while FDCE enrolled five Fellows.Learning how to do a sensitivity analysis (also known as a what-if analysis) within a financial model was mind-blowing at the time, and a tool I still use today.”After completing the TFL program, fellow 2020 participant Herintsitohaina Razakamanarivo, a professor at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar’s primary public university, was quickly recruited to manage staff for the country’s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.There, he managed the group’s insurance and its Environmental, Health, and Safety program, which encompassed over 880 projects in 27 different states.A place of unique biodiversity and natural features, the island nation, located 250 miles off the coast of East Africa in the Indian Ocean, is struggling to adapt to a changing climate.“I enrolled in FDCE primarily for the project finance module.The operation has been so successful that the UNHCR has tabbed Bangladesh Refugee Operation as a model for climate action for other operations in Asia and the Pacific to follow.“Only two years after that moment, I found myself managing the largest renewable insurance portfolio in the U.S.Interest in the admissions-based programs, which offer a mix of self-directed coursework and weekly live sessions taught by YSE, Yale, and external experts in their field, has continued to increase from almost every area in the world.They also have the option to complete a one-week, immersive field course in a tropical forest setting, which gives participants an opportunity to share the experiences of landholders and others who are implementing innovative interventions.Two years later Braxton achieved his goal when he joined Goldman Sachs Renewable Power Group (now MN8 Energy) as a rotational analyst.Since the start of the crisis, Md. Ehsanul Hoque, an environmental officer with the U.N.

climate-related shocks, and the food security crisis linked to the war in Ukraine.”Project implementation during the first phase has enabled more than 1,875,461 women and children under five to receive health and nutrition services through 4,526 community sites and 1,081 primary health care facilities strengthened with necessary nutrition and health commodities and equipment.The stunting rate has decreased by 7.63% over four years in seven regions where the program is activeWASHINGTON, July 13, 2022 – The World Bank approved today the second phase of the Improving Nutrition Outcomes Program using the Multiphase Programmatic Approach amounting to $85 million consisting of a $42,5 million credit and a $42,5 million grant to continue helping Madagascar tackle widespread stunting in childrenChronic malnutrition is the biggest impediment to a child’s potential and to Madagascar’s long-term human capital development and economic growth.“In the context of deepening fragility and food insecurity, the importance of this multiphase programmatic approach to improving nutrition outcomes has become increasingly evident and requires multisectoral approaches to accelerate progress for stunting reduction,” said Maud Juquois, Senior Health Economist in Madagascar.The second phase will continue to support the nine regions under phase 1, and the following four regions will also be added: Androy, Anosy, Atsimo Atsinanana, and Atsinanana, three of which are among the most climate vulnerable regions in Madagascar.This 10-year program was designed to reach close to 75% of children under the five, starting in the regions that have the highest stunting rates in the country and progressively expanding to 15 regions.Evidence shows that greater coverage of food security, social protection, and nutrition interventions for the most vulnerable and poorest contribute to efforts to reduce poverty, chronic food insecurity, and stunting.The second phase will maintain the focus on the core activities of increasing quality and accessibility of essential reproductive, maternal, and child health and nutrition services, demand generation, and systems strengthening.Stunting affects four out of every ten children under five in Madagascar, the equivalent of an estimated 1.7 million children, which is one of the highest rates in the world.This second phase will also increase synergies with other sectoral investments, particularly in the areas of agriculture and social protection, to support improved nutrition outcomes.Reducing the prevalence of stunting is a critical milestone for improving the learning outcomes for children and future productivity.By 2028, the program is expected to reduce the number of stunted children by 30% in targeted regions.This rate of improvement of 0.86 percentage points per year is better than the average rate of improvement in the Africa region.With the geographical expansion of phase 2, it would cover 65% of under five children by end of 2026.In addition, 7.7% of children under five are wasted (too thin for their height), which increases the risks of morbidity and mortality.The prevalence of stunting has decreased from 50.1% in 2008-9 to 39.8% in 2021.If such trends are sustained, this will have a lasting impact onMadagascar’s human capital,” said Marie-Chantal Uwanyiligira, World Bank Country Manager for

Support for Resilient Livelihoods in the South of Madagascar (Mionjo) Project.The southern region of Madagascar is experiencing the worst drought in 40 years, a dire situation that is amplified by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other covariate shocks, and has resulted in a deteriorating food security situation that includes cute risk of famine in some of the hardest-hit communes.In response to threats posed by locusts, this additional financing will also finance locust surveillance and control measures led by the national locust management agency, with technical backstopping from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).At the village level, the project will upgrade water supply sources to render them more efficient and capable of supporting both human and animal consumption, and in some areas, irrigated production of higher value, nutrient rich foods.“This additional funding from the World Bank for the Mionjo project reinforces our efforts to enable people to develop income-generating activities and support development.”At the household level, the aim is to reach those who are most food insecure with immediate water and cash assistance and climate-smart innovations to jumpstart their agriculture activities and help recover their livelihoods and assets.This includes stepping up the fight against malnutrition, which requires concrete projects that empower the population and provide vital water infrastructure that is key to irrigating crops and protecting again the impacts of drought,\" said Andry Rajoelina, President of the Republic of Madagascar.It builds upon the objectives of the original Mionjo project to address longer-term development challenges and strengthen local government in the southern regions.It will benefit more than 920,000 people in 14 districts across three regions in the South (Anosy, Androy, Atsimo Andrefana), which are among the hardest hit by the crisis.The project’s activities benefit from a cross-sectoral collaboration across four ministries, and involve investments in agriculture, water, environment and decentralization.“The government has prioritized climate change adaptation and development in the southern region of the country.“We cannot develop the south of Madagascar, one of the poorest regions of the country, without breaking this recurrent cycle of drought.They will
